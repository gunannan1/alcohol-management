This is the front-end of alcohol project management system.  
Its original code is from an open source template https://github.com/macrozheng/mall-admin-web   
Then I modified it to suit this project.  
Since i know little about front end, the code here is very disorder.  

## Notice(If you are familiar with back font, please ignore)
1. If you change the deployment server , please change BASE_API in prod.env.js in config package  
2. assetsPublicPath in config/index.js: when deployment using './'  when local testing using '/'
